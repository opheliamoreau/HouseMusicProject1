# HouseMusicProject1
My project is a Python coded musical composition using the platform Earsketch. The genre of music is inspired by iconic house music artists David Guetta and Avicii.

## General Information
- The artistic challenge being embraced is the art of music and how it can evoke certain feelings. This is a passionate topic of mine as I feel that music can be a form of clearing one’s mind. I hope to learn how different music compositions and coding complexities such as data structures and algorithms can really impact the way a song sounds, and therefore one’s emotions towards a song.
- The prototype I have chosen to build is a musical composition, more specifically an upbeat piece inspired by house music artists, such as Avicii and David Guetta. This genre of music is becoming increasingly popular amongst younger generations, and there is a rise in artists creating house music. This relates to my project challenge as creating this prototype will help me to understand the complexities of coding music and the outcomes of creating an upbeat musical composition.
- I have chosen to use the coding environment of Earsketch (Python) to create my musical composition. This platform seemed clearer than the other option (Ruby), and having learnt the basics of Python, producing this prototype felt achievable.



## Resources Used
- Earsketch Website
- Access to a computer and WiFi
- Sound and code libraries (provided by Earsketch)
- Basic understanding of Python 
- Basic understanding of music theory (rhythm, melody) to create a complex and engaging prototype
- Earsketch tutorials to learn how to use the platform effectively, and making use of the Musical Coding Resource page on Canvas.

## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.


## Usage
Examples of code used for my HouseMusicProject1 in Earsketch

`    #calling function of chorus to play and adding the start and end times of the piece
chorus (21,37)
        #printing the message of chorus of the coded song 
print ("The chorus of this song is the climax where listeners can feel the entire experience of house music.")`

`    #creating function for intro so it can be called later when it is supposed to be played
def intro(start,end) : 
    fitMedia (YG_TECHNO_FILTERED_LOOP_1, 1, 1, 5)
    fitMedia (Y39_BASS_1, 10, 2, 5)`
