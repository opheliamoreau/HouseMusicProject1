# HouseMusicProject1
My project is a Python coded musical composition using the platform Earsketch. The genre of music is inspired by iconic house music artists David Guetta and Avicii.

## General Information
- The artistic challenge being embraced is the art of music and how it can evoke certain feelings. This is a passionate topic of mine as I feel that music can be a form of clearing one’s mind. I hope to learn how different music compositions and coding complexities such as data structures and algorithms can really impact the way a song sounds, and therefore one’s emotions towards a song.
- The prototype I have chosen to build is a musical composition, more specifically an upbeat piece inspired by house music artists, such as Avicii and David Guetta. This genre of music is becoming increasingly popular amongst younger generations, and there is a rise in artists creating house music. This relates to my project challenge as creating this prototype will help me to understand the complexities of coding music and the outcomes of creating an upbeat musical composition.
- I have chosen to use the coding environment of Earsketch (Python) to create my musical composition. This platform seemed clearer than the other option (Ruby), and having learnt the basics of Python, producing this prototype felt achievable.
