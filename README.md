# HouseMusicProject1
My project is a Python coded musical composition using the platform Earsketch. The genre of music is inspired by iconic house music artists David Guetta and Avicii.

## General Information
- The artistic challenge being embraced is the art of music and how it can evoke certain feelings. This is a passionate topic of mine as I feel that music can be a form of clearing one’s mind. I hope to learn how different music compositions and coding complexities such as data structures and algorithms can really impact the way a song sounds, and therefore one’s emotions towards a song.
- The prototype I have chosen to build is a musical composition, more specifically an upbeat piece inspired by house music artists, such as Avicii and David Guetta. This genre of music is becoming increasingly popular amongst younger generations, and there is a rise in artists creating house music. This relates to my project challenge as creating this prototype will help me to understand the complexities of coding music and the outcomes of creating an upbeat musical composition.
- I have chosen to use the coding environment of Earsketch (Python) to create my musical composition. This platform seemed clearer than the other option (Ruby), and having learnt the basics of Python, producing this prototype felt achievable.



## Resources Used
- Earsketch Website
- Access to a computer and WiFi
- Basic understanding of Python 
- Basic understanding of music theory (rhythm, melody) to create a complex and engaging prototype
- Earsketch tutorials to learn how to use the platform effectively, and making use of the Musical Coding Resource page on Canvas. 


## Features
Earsketch features used:
- Coding Integration
- Music Composition Tools
- Sound and Code Library
- Learning Resources


## Setup
To play my coded music composition on Earsketch, click on the green button 'run' in the Code Editor section of the platform to run the script. Then click the green 'play button' in the Digital Audio Workstation section of the platform to listen to the final product. You can scroll down in the Code Editor section to view all the code used.

## Usage
Examples of code used for my HouseMusicProject1 in Earsketch

`#calling function of chorus to play and adding the start and end times of the piece 
chorus (21,37)  
        #printing the message of chorus of the coded song 
print ("The chorus of this song is the climax where listeners can feel the entire experience of house music.")`

`#creating function for intro so it can be called later when it is supposed to be played 
def intro(start,end) : 
    fitMedia (YG_TECHNO_FILTERED_LOOP_1, 1, 1, 5)
    fitMedia (Y39_BASS_1, 10, 2, 5)`


## Project Status
Project is: completed and no longer being worked on. 

I have finished making a short demo of a house music composed piece, with an intro, verse/bridge and chorus. This gives an overall idea of a potential lengthened version of the composition.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Work on further including unique code
- Aim to make the code even more complex

To do:
- Develop a deeper knowledge of Python
- Continue trial and error with code


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by house music artists such as Avicii and David Guetta.
- This project was based on our Module 1 Week 3 tutorial.
